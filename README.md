**Abstract:** *Smartphone photography has improved considerably over the years, particularly in low-light conditions. Thanks to better sensors, advanced noise reduction and night modes, smartphones can now capture detailed wide-field astronomical images, from the Moon to deep sky objects. These innovations have transformed them into pocket telescopes, making astrophotography more accessible than ever. In this paper, we present AstroSmartphoneDataset, a dataset of wide-field astronomical images collected since 2021 with various smartphones, and we show how we have used these images to train Deep Learning models for trails detection.*


This repository contains an unofficial implementation of the paper "Toward a Public Dataset of Wide-Field Astronomical Images Captured with Smartphones".

> **Note:** This template is primarily designed for Machine Learning papers, but can be adapted for other domains. You may need to modify files like `src/model.py`, the `Results & Status` section, and the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

## Getting Started

1.  **Set up the environment:**

    ```bash
    # Using pip
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    # Or using uv (a faster alternative)
    uv venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    uv pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the code:**

    *(The author of this implementation should document usage instructions here.)*

    ```bash
    # Example: Run a demo
    # python demo.py

    # Example: Train the model
    # python train.py
    ```

## Results & Status

*(The author should update this section with their results or the current implementation status.)*

## Implementation Notes

*(The author should add any relevant notes about their implementation approach, assumptions, or limitations here.)*
