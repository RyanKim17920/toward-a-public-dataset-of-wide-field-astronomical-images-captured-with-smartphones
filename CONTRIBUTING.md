# Contributing to this Implementation

Thank you for contributing! This guide provides tips for implementing the paper and documenting your work.

## Philosophy

**Keep it simple.** This template provides a minimal structure to get started without being restrictive. Add complexity only as needed.

**Learning > Perfect Reproduction.** The goal is to understand the paper and share that understanding. It's okay if results aren't a perfect match. "Architecture-only" implementations are highly valuable.

## Getting Started

> **Note:** This template is primarily designed for Machine Learning papers. If you are implementing a different type of paper, you may want to rename `src/model.py` to something more generic (like `src/implementation.py`) and adjust the documentation accordingly.

1.  **Add dependencies** to `requirements.txt`.
2.  **Implement the model** in `src/model.py`.
3.  **Document your progress** in the `README.md`.

If you need more structure, feel free to add files like `src/train.py`, `src/data.py`, or a `configs/` directory.

## Documenting Your Work

A good `README.md` is the most important part of your contribution.

### Implementation Status
Be clear about what you've done.

**Example (Architecture Only):**
```markdown
## Implementation Status

- Model architecture implemented in `src/model.py`.
- Forward pass tested to ensure correct output shapes.
- Training has not been performed.
```

**Example (Trained Model):**
```markdown
## Results

| Metric | Paper | This Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 95.2% | 94.8% |

**Notes:**
- Trained for 50 epochs instead of 100 due to compute constraints.
- Used the Adam optimizer instead of the one specified in the paper.
```

### Limitations
Document any differences from the paper. This helps others understand your work.

- "Used a simplified data augmentation pipeline."
- "Could not implement the custom loss function described in Section 3.2. due to limited information"

## What Makes a Good Implementation?

- **Clarity:** Write code that is easy to read and understand.
- **Honesty:** Be transparent about what you did and didn't do.
- **Focus:** Implement the core contributions of the paper first.

You don't need to stress about perfectly matching the paper's results, especially if it requires significant computational resources.

Good luck!
